### Electron Simulation Logic

#### 1. Initialization
- Pygame starts with an 800x600 screen.
- User inputs the number of electrons.
- Each electron has a random color and starts at the center.

#### 2. Motion and Repulsion
- Electrons repel each other using Coulomb-like force: `F = CHARGE / distance^2`.
- Acceleration is computed from forces, updating velocity and position.
- Damping (`0.99`) prevents infinite acceleration.

#### 3. Boundary Handling
- Electrons bounce off walls to stay within bounds.

#### 4. Visualization
- Electrons are drawn as circles with trails.
- Screen updates at 60 FPS until the user exits.
